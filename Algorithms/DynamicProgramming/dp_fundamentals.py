"""
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a technique that solves some particular
type of problems in Polynomial Time.
Dynamic Programming solutions are faster than exponential
brute method and can be easily proved for their correctness.
Before we study how to think Dynamically for a problem,
we need to learn:

    1.Overlapping Sub-problems
    2.Optimal Substructure Property
"""


"""
Steps to solve a DP
    1) Identify if it is a DP problem
    2) Decide a state expression with
       least parameters
    3) Formulate state relationship
    4) Do tabulation (or add memoization)
